## My solution to [Walmart Trip Type Classification challenge] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification)

This is the strongest model from my final ensemble. This model gives the log loss score 0.589 and approximately 59th place on the leaderboard (top 5.5%).

Here is the graphical representation of the solution:

Below, I will go over each of the stages in more detail. However, what is interesting about this solution is that the ensemble stage models (NN and GBT) are not trained at all! I simply did not have time to train them since I entered this competition a week before the deadline (I used only 3 submissions overall). My strategy was to choose reasonable parameters together with relatively small learning rates and determine the number of epochs for NN classifier and the number of trees for GBT classifier using early stopping. I will probably never find it out but it seems that appropriate training at the ensembling stage could push the LB score of this model significantly further. Thus, the relatively high score of this model can be attributed to three crucial elements:
1. Extensive feature engineering
2. Stacked generalization
3. Amazing python libraries XGBoost (GBT) and Keras (NN) which produce good results even with minimum amount of training

### Project Description

The task was to classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they have purchased. Walmart has categorized the trips contained in the data into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. Contestants were challenged to recreate this categorization/clustering with a more limited set of features. This could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips. The submitted solution had to be in the form of matrix of predicted probabilities with dimensions (# of customers, # of trip types).

### Data

Data fields:

- TripType - a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that we had to predict
- VisitNumber - an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer
- Weekday - the weekday of the trip
- Upc - the UPC number of the product purchased
- ScanCount - the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.
- DepartmentDescription - a high-level description of the item's department
- FinelineNumber - a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart

Number of rows in the training dataset: 647,054. Number of rows in the test dataset: 653,646

The data was multi-dimensional (several rows per customer). However, the submission format assumed only one row of predicted probabilities per customer. Therefore, the dataset must have been transformed from long to wide format, which created enormous opportunities for feature engineering.
